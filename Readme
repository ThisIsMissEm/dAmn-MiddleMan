## About

dAmn MiddleMan was a past project of Sam (sumopiggy/sammulqueen.nz) and Micheil (Miksago). It provides a simple pub/sub driven interface to the internals of the deviantART Message Networks' chat application.

The project was originally started by Sam, and then made into a collaboration with myself, where we introduced the pub/sub interface.

We hope you have fun using this, and at this stage, we will not be providing docs for MiddleMan. Try reading the source code.
