# About

dAmn MiddleMan was a past project of Sam (sumopiggy/sammulqueen.nz) and Micheil (Miksago). It provides a simple pub/sub driven interface to the internals of the deviantART Message Networks' chat application.

The project was originally started by Sam, and then made into a collaboration with myself, where we introduced the pub/sub interface.

We hope you have fun using this, and at this stage, we will not be providing docs for MiddleMan. Try reading the source code.

# Licensing

When this project was started, we did not specify any license, so you can do what you please with it more or less, not that you could sell it or make money off it, however, remember that the original code is intellectual property of Sam and Micheil.
